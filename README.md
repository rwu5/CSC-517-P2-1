# TODO
* Librarian feature
* Edit profile
* Validation
* Send Mail
* Calculate fine
* Test

# Run the Library Management System
* To run the project, go to https://still-taiga-41852.herokuapp.com
* Sign up as admin or student. (To test the function, we recomment you sign up as admin for the first time). Please fill in the name, password and password confirmation.
* After signing up as admin, you will be direct to the main page of the Library Management System. An admin is able to: 1) Create an university. 2) Create a library for an existing university. 3) Create a book for a library. 4) Add or delete book collections.
* The creation of a student role needs information of email, name, password (and password confirmation), university (admin has to create this university first for students loging in), and education level. The same email address can be used for signing up for multiply roles. (eg. I am both admin and student)
* Students on student page can view the created universities, libraries, his/her wish list, and current borrowed books. Students can borrow book by click "show all the book", and "details", and click "borrow". To return a book, go to "my current book", and click "return" on the right side of the shown book.

## Librarian

A librarian should have at least the following attributes:

Anyone can sign up as a librarian using their email, name and password. After signing up, they must be approved by an admin before they can perform the following tasks:

* View list of all the books that are checked out from their library.
* View the borrowing history of the books from their library.
* View the list of students with overdue books from their library along with overdue fine.


## Students

A student should have at least the following attributes: 
* Email (unique for each account), 
* Name 
* Password
* Educational Level (Undergraduate/Graduate/PhD Student)
* University 
* Maximum number of books (**N**) that can be borrowed at any given time (Based on their educational level, For ex: Undergraduate - 2, Masters - 4, PhD - 6).

Anyone can sign up as a student using their email, name and password. After signing up, they can perform the following tasks:

* View the list of all the libraries
* Edit profile to modify email, name and password only.
* View all books
* Check out/Request/Return a book from any library associated with their University.
* Renew/Modify/Delete a reservation.

* Search through the books
  * Search by title
  * Search by author

* Bookmark a book they are interested in.
* View their bookmarked books.
* At any given time, a student can borrow a max of '**N**' number of books based on their educational level.
* View the overdue fines for his/her account. 
* Receive an email when any of their book request is sucessful.

### Book Hold Request
* If the book is available, proceed to check out:
  * If the book is in Special Cllection list, add this to Librarian's approval list and wait. 
  * Otherwise, add the book to student's checked out list
* If the book is unavailable or the student has checked out **N** books already,
  * Inform the student that the book is unavailable or max limit reached.
  * Create a book hold request if the student wants to continue requesting.  
  
* Number of hold requests for a book should be visible to every user

### Returning a book
* If there is no hold request for a book, return and increase the available count of the book
* If there is a pending hold request,
  * Approve the hold request and add the book to the checked out list of the requested student
  * Send a mail to the student that the book is checked out.

## Notes
* There will be only one admin in the system, and this account will be preconfigured. 
* A librarian can add more than one book.  
* Each student can bookmark/request multiple books. They can also remove themselves from the bookmark/request list for a book.
* It’s up to you whether a user should be able to sign up as both an librarian and a student with the same email address or not.  Either way is OK.

## Miscellaneous

### Testing

* Thoroughly test one model and one controller (prefer RSpec testing framework).

### Deployment
**_Please ensure that your deployment is always accessible for grading_**. You can deploy your app to any of the following: (Try to perform continuous deployment)

* Heroku or any similar PaaS (OpenShift, etc.) with free plans
* Amazon AWS

### Bonus (Extra Credit)
You can do any or all of the below tasks for extra credit (each item below is worth **5 points**).
* No student/librarian should access any private content associated with other student/librarian/admin's account.
* All users can use their LinkedIn/Google/Facebook account (implementing any one of them is enough) to log into the system.
